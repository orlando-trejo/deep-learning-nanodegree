# deep-learning-nanodegree
This repository contains class assignments and projects from my completed Udacity's Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree.

I completed the following projects for the course:

### Project 0 - Predict Bike Rentals

In this project, I built a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership. The neural network was built manually by completing the NeuralNetwork class with train and run methods. The trained model, consisting of 20 hidden units, predicted the general rental trends over a large part of December except for the holiday season.

### Project 1 - Image Classification

In this project, I built a model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains images of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. A neural network model was built using TensorFlow. The model consisted of 2D convolution, max pooling, and fully connected layers. The trained model yield a 0.59 accuracy for the test set. 

### Project 2 - Language Translation

In this project, I built a model to translate sentences from English to French. A sequence-to-sequence model was built using TensorFlow. Recurrent neural networks and long short-term memory networks were used for the encoding and decoding layers. The trained model translated some sentence better then others given the limited dataset.
