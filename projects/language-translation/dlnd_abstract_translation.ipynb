      "we present an ultra deep survey for neptune trojans using the subaru m and magellan m telescopes the survey reached a detection efficiency in the r band at magnitudes and covered square degrees of sky this depth corresponds to neptune trojans that are about km in radius assuming an albedo of a paucity of smaller neptune trojans radii km compared to larger ones was found the brightest neptune trojans appear to follow a steep power law slope q similar to the brightest objects in the other known stable reservoirs such as the kuiper belt, jupiter trojans and main belt asteroids we find a roll over for the neptune trojans that occurs around a radii of r km mags, which is also very similar to the other stable reservoirs all the observed stable regions in the the solar system show evidence for missing intermediate sized planetesimals misps this indicates a primordial and not collisional origin, which suggests planetesimal formation proceeded directly from small to large objects the scarcity of intermediate and smaller sized neptune trojans may limit them as being a strong source for the short period comets\n",
      "significant proton fluxes were detected in the near wake region of the moon by an ion mass spectrometer on board chandrayaan the energy of these nightside protons is slightly higher than the energy of the solar wind protons the protons are detected close to the lunar equatorial plane at a circ solar zenith angle, ie, circ behind the terminator at a height of km the protons come from just above the local horizon, and move along the magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame we compared the observed proton flux with the predictions from analytical models of an electrostatic plasma expansion into a vacuum the observed velocity was higher than the velocity predicted by analytical models by a factor of to the simple analytical models cannot explain the observed ion dynamics along the magnetic field in the vicinity of the moon\n",
      "we study the role of ambipolar diffusion ad on the non linear evolution of the mri in protoplanetary disks using the strong coupling limit, which applies when the electron recombination time is much shorter than the orbital time the effect of ad in this limit is characterized by the dimensionless number am, the frequency of which neutral particles collide with ions normalized to the orbital frequency we perform three dimensional unstratified shearing box simulations of the mri over a wide range of am as well as different magnetic field strengths and geometries the saturation level of the mri turbulence depends on the magnetic geometry and increases with the net magnetic flux there is an upper limit to the net flux for sustained turbulence, corresponding to the requirement that the most unstable vertical wavelength be less than the disk scale height correspondingly, at a given am, there exists a maximum value of the turbulent stress alphamax for am, the largest stress is associated with a field geometry that has both net vertical and toroidal flux in this case, we confirm the results of linear analyses that show the fastest growing mode has a non zero radial wave number with growth rate exceeding the pure vertical field case we find there is a very tight correlation between the turbulent stress alpha and the plasma betapgaspmagalpha at the saturated state of the mri turbulence regardless of field geometry, and alphamax rapidly decreases with decreasing am in particular, we quote alphamax for am and alphamax for am\n",
      "measurements of the interplanetary magnetic field imf over several solar cycles do not agree with computed values of open magnetic flux from potential field extrapolations the discrepancy becomes greater around solar maximum in each cycle, when the imf can be twice as strong as predicted by the potential field model here we demonstrate that this discrepancy may be resolved by allowing for electric currents in the low corona below solar radii we present a quasi static numerical model of the large scale coronal magnetic evolution, which systematically produces these currents through flux emergence and shearing by surface motions the open flux is increased by at solar maximum, but only at solar minimum, bringing it in line with estimates from imf measurements the additional open flux in the non potential model arises through inflation of the magnetic field by electric currents, with super imposed fluctuations due to coronal mass ejections the latter are modelled by the self consistent ejection of twisted magnetic flux ropes\n",
      "we have designed an inquiry based laboratory activity on transiting extrasolar planets for an introductory college level astronomy class the activity was designed with the intent of simultaneously teaching science process skills and factual content about transits and light curves in the activity, groups of two to four students each formulate a specific science question and design and carry out an investigation using a table top model of a star and orbiting planet each group then presents their findings to other students in their class in a final presentation, the instructors integrate students findings with a summary of how measured light curves indicate properties of planetary systems the activity debuted at hartnell college in november and has also been adapted for a lecture based astronomy course at uc santa cruz we present the results of student surveys before and after the astronomy course at hartnell and discuss how well our activity promotes students confidence and identity as scientists, relative to traditional lab activities\n",
      "several photometric surveys for short period transiting giant planets have targeted a number of open clusters, but no convincing detections have been made although each individual survey typically targeted an insufficient number of stars to expect a detection assuming the frequency of short period giant planets found in surveys of field stars, we ask whether the lack of detections from the ensemble of open cluster surveys is inconsistent with expectations from the field planet population we select a subset of existing transit surveys with well defined selection criteria and quantified detection efficiencies, and statistically combine their null results to show that the upper limit on the planet fraction is and for rj and rj planets, respectively in the p day period range for the period range of p days we find upper limits of and for rj and rj, respectively comparing these results to the frequency of short period giant planets around field stars in both radial velocity and transit surveys, we conclude that there is no evidence to suggest that open clusters support a fundamentally different planet population than field stars given the available data\n",
      "as an alternative to either directly assimilating radiances or the naive use of retrieved profiles of temperature, humidity, aerosols, and chemical species, a strategy is described that makes use of the so called averaging kernel ak and other information from the retrieval process this ak approach has the potential to improve the use of remotely sensed observations of the atmosphere first, we show how to use the ak and the retrieval noise covariance to transform the retrieved quantities into observations that are unbiased and have uncorrelated errors, and to eliminate both the smoothing inherent in the retrieval process and the effect of the prior since the effect of the prior is removed, any prior, including the forecast from the data assimilation cycle can be used then we show how to transform this result into eof space, when a truncated eof series has been used in the retrieval process this provides a degree of data compression and eliminates those transformed variables that have very small information content in both approaches a vertical interpolation from the dynamical model coordinate to the radiative transfer coordinate is required we define an algorithm using the eof representation to optimize this vertical interpolation\n",
      "correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanets can be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts and provide valuable clues about the planet formation process we analyze a sample of stars drawn from the california planet survey targets to determine the empirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giant planet as a function of its mass and metallicity our stellar sample ranges from m dwarfs with masses as low as msun to intermediate mass subgiants with masses as high as msun in agreement with previous studies, our sample exhibits a planet metallicity correlation at all stellar masses the fraction of stars that harbor giant planets scales as f propto feh we can rule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars at confidence, which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets are not likely due to convective envelope pollution our data also rule out a constant planet occurrence rate for feh , indicating that giant planets continue to become rarer at sub solar metallicities we also find that planet occurrence increases with stellar mass f propto mstar, characterized by a rise from around m dwarfs msun to around a stars msun, at solar metallicity we argue that the correlation between stellar properties and giant planet occurrence is strong supporting evidence of the core accretion model of planet formation\n",
      "among other things, studies of the formation and evolution of planetary systems currently draw on two important observational resources the precise characterization available for planets that transit their parent stars and the frequency and nature of systems with multiple planets thus far, the study of transiting exoplanets has focused almost exclusively on systems with only one planet, except for considering the influence of additional planets on the transit light curve, mostly through transit timing variations ttvs this work considers systems where multiple planets are seen to transit the same star and concludes that such multi transiting systems will be the most information rich planetary systems besides our own solar system five new candidate multi transiting systems from emphkepler have been announced in steffen et al , though these candidates have not yet been fully confirmed as planets in anticipation of the likely confirmation of multi transiting systems, we discuss the value of these systems in detail for example, proper interpretation of transit timing variations is significantly improved in multi transiting systems the true mutual inclination, a valuable probe of planetary formation, can also be well determined in certain systems, especially through rossiter mclaughlin measurements of each planet in addition, such systems may undergo predictable and observable mutual events, where one planet crosses over the other, which allow for unique constraints on various physical and orbital parameters, particularly the mutual inclination\n",
      "we discuss one important aspect of waldmeier effect which says that the stronger cycles rise rapidly than weaker cycles we studied four different data set of solar activity indices, and find strong linear correlation between rise rates and amplitudes of solar activity we study this effect theoretically by introducing suitable stochastic fluctuations in our regular solar dynamo model\n",
